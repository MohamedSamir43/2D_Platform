# 2D_Platform

Hello , My Name is Mohamed Samir 

And i aspire to become a great game developer one day 

In this package u will find basic platform code for any 2D game u want to create

The system is made following OOP princples as follows

First Character is an abstact class , which contains different aspects of the characters both monsters and (Player)

Player script inherits from the character all its aspects and adds movements functionalities , and input from both PC device and any mobile device ( IOS , Android )

Enemy script inherits from the character all its aspects and controls the AI states of the enemy ( Idle , Patrol , Ranged , Melee ) 

There are 4 states for the enemy state which implemnt the IEnemyState interface
 
 1 - Idle
 2 - Patrol
 3 - Ranged 
 4 - Melee
 
The Player Animation state machine is trigger driven

I have much help from my great tutor which i didnt get to know his name :D 

But u can find him on youtube.com/inScopeStudios

This project will teach u who to code in C# , learn some design patterns and oop princples i hope u find it useful
